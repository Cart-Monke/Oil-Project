            <h2>Good Oils</h2>
            <p>
              Despite the unhealthy nature of these processed oils, and the
              common idea that fats aren't good for you in general, some very
              much are! Olive oil is an easy to obtain oil that can be found in
              most households, and is very good for you. Especially your heart.
              Studies about the Mediterranean diet (the one with the lowest rate
              of heart disease) found olive oil as a major component of that
              diet. And further examination of this oil found that it lowers
              inflammation, improves the lining of your blood vessels, and
              prevents excessive clotting which are all associated with heart
              disease. Olive oil has also been linked to reducing the risk of
              developing Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes, and even cancer as well
              as helping to prevent strokes! Also, coconut oil! Coconut oil is a
              very healthy alternative, containing many necessary fats. It has
              many uses that can improve cognitive function, metabolism, as well
              as hair, and skin health. Also, coconut oil! Coconut oil is a very

            <h2>Don't Stress!</h2>
            <p>
              The facts related to processed seed oils combined with how
              widespread they are make it easy to fear them. But in reality,
              like anything, these oils are fine in moderation. In small
              amounts, they won't have a significant effect on your health. They
              simply make things taste amazing. As long as you maintain a
              healthy diet most of the time, and don't go overboard with these
              oils, then don't stress.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Seed oils are easy to produce, cheap to buy, convenient to use,
              and make things taste delicious. But at a hidden cost of being
              very unhealthy. Now you should be a bit more educated and a bit
              more aware of what you're eating. But don't worry. As long as you
              make good decisions most of the time, there's no reason not to
              enjoy a bag of chips every once in a while!
