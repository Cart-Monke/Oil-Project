            <p>
              Every culture and every household is familiar with oils. Canola
              oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, peanut oil, the list goes on and
              on. Oils are classified as any kind of fat that is in liquid form
              at room temperature. Some of these oils are healthy for us. They
              provide us with necessary nutrients and healthy fats. Some of
              them, however, when overly processed are dangerous. But despite
              this danger, they have become so widely used over the past few
              decades that they are largely inescapable. This class of oil is
              seed oils. Oils produced through the processing of sunflower
              seeds, rapeseeds, soybeans, corn, and more. Everyone can find
              these oils at their local market. For a few dollars you can bring
              home an entire gallon. But is there a hidden cost?

          <h2>How are they made?</h2>
          <p>
            The production of these processed oils begins with the harvesting of
            the seed. The seeds will be shelled if they have a shell, and then
            conditioned through heating to prepare them for the first step of
            extraction. Pressing. The pressing extracts some of the oils out of
            the seeds. The dry mash is then broken down further and moved to the
            second kind of extraction. Hexane extraction. Hexane is mixed with
            the mash to produce a slurry. This slurry is then heated. Most of
            the hexane will be evaporated during this step. The oil (and small
            hexane leftovers) is then distilled, the hexane will be collected
            for repurposing, and the mash is sold for animal feed. Finally, all
            the oil is bleached using a bleaching clay, and then deodorized to
            remove and free fatty acids and volatile components that resulted
            from the extraction process. This leaves you with the colorless oil
            sold on the shelf.
