            <h2>Oils and our health</h2>
            <p>
              The problem with these oils is that the amount we have begun
              consuming them has skyrocketed since their invention. The ratio of
              omega-6 fatty acids (present in these oils) to omega-3 fatty acids
              (found more in fish / nuts / un-processed fats) that the average
              person consumes has skyrocketed from about 1:1 to 20:1. These
              disparities in fatty acid type consumption are linked to numerous
              health effects. This disparity is linked to obesity, heart
              disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammatory bowel
              disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. Also, the
              nutrients that are present in unprocessed oils aren't found in
              these processed oils. The bleaching and deodorization steps of the
              refining processes remove all impurities in the oil, volatile
              compounds and good compounds alike. Not to mention the high
              calorie content of these oils. This in itself isn't the problem. A
              handful of walnuts has more calories than a tablespoon of these
              oils. The problem is that they are in everything. It is well known
              that the U.S is suffering an obesity crisis, and the use of these
              oils in so many products on our market shelves has invested their
              fair share into causing this crisis.
